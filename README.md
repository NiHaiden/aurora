# Project Aurora
Don't like Gnome but want the all the goodies the awesome Bluefin Image provides? Aurora is a Bluefin fork which utilizes the KDE Desktop environment instead of Gnome, while keeping the core things that make Bluefin awesome the same.

# What is Aurora anyway?
Aurora is a brand-new, customized and fine-tuned KDE experience that gears towards power users and developers alike. The images contain many useful scripts and tools, all derived from the awesome Bluefin project by the Universal-Blue Team. It combines these nice things with the KDE desktop environment which is a beautiful, modern and sleek desktop experience packed with features. 

Under the hood we use Fedora, Universal-Blue and other great technologies to deliver this rock-stable desktop experience. 

## What images are there? 
We have two kinds of images, each with support for different hardware types. 

- Aurora: A customized experience with the focus on powerusers, including the Prompt terminal and other useful things like fonts. 
- Aurora-DX: The developer experience. Comes with several features, including preinstalled Cloud-Native tools, container tools and runtimes and so much more, including preinstalled VS Code and scripts for getting your favorite Jetbrains IDE setup in a matter of seconds (depending on your internet speed) ü´°.

Each image is available in a Surface, Framework, Asus and Nvidia Version to support every exotic hardware out there. 

At the end I want to give a big shoutout to [The Universal Blue Project](https://github.com/ublue-os) because without these guys, Aurora would have never been possible. Thanks so much. 

Peace out. ‚úåÔ∏è
